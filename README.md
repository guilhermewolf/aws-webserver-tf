This folder contains the files for deploy an EC2 instance under a load balancer. The EC2 instance is managed by an auto scaling group thats scale in with those parameters:
- **Scale in**: CPU utilization > 80%
- **Scale out**: CPU Utilization < 60%
- **Minimun size**: 1
- **Maximun size**: 3

The EC2 Instances are being generated by a launch configuration, within this configuration there is bootstraps scripts for installing apache and a SSM agent for connecting to the EC2 isntance via AWS Systems Manager.

terraform plan
terraform apply
